## Test and validation review

- Historical checkout compilation was not repeated because this patch changes only documentation/language fixtures/oracles and no Rust or Cargo inputs.
- Historical checkout: `cargo test --locked --quiet` **failed** at this exact commit (23s): `run_enforces_capture_list_modes`.
- This test failure is inherited from `cabfc772`; this patch did not introduce it. The originating review contains the root finding.
- `git diff --check` passed for this commit against its first parent.
- No test files or executable language test fixtures changed in this patch.

## Findings

No correctness, safety, or integration blocker was identified in this commit under the stated review scope. This is not a claim that every behavior was re-executed at the historical checkout; it means the patch, exact-checkout compile result (when applicable), tests/oracles changed, and later interactions did not expose a commit-local defect.

## Disposition

No new defect was attributed to this patch, but it is not independently green because it inherits the unresolved test failure from `cabfc772`. Correct or squash the originating commit before retaining this point in history.
